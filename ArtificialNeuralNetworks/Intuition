ANN was started with an idea to mimic the animal or human brain on how decisions are taken based on a sequence of events
or inputs that the brain receives. In order to understand this better, we can visualize the human brain which has 
millions of neurons.

Structure of Neurons:

1. Nucleus: This is the core of the neuron and is located at the center of the neuron body. The main decision making takes place in
ths neuron.
2. Dendrites: The hair which are present on the Neuron body like branches are called dendrites. These dendrites receive 
electric impulses from the Axon of another neuron. This is considered as an input.
3. Axon: The Axon is the tail of the neuron which connects the neuron body to another neuron. This is done by passing a 
signal from the Axon to the dendrites of another neuron. It is like passing an output to another neighbouring neuron. 
4. Synapse: The weights of the inputs passed on by the Axon of one Neuron to the Dendrites of another Neuron.

A Basic Neural Network:

PERCEPTRON MODEL:

A perceptron consists of one layer of input which has one neuron, one hidden layer containing one neuron and one output layer
containing one neuron. The neuron in the hidden layer receives an input from the neuron in the input layer,
applies an activation function and then sends the output with some weight to the neuron in the output layer.

The value obtained by the neuron in the hidden layer is sum of product of weight and input values of all neurons.
On this value an activation function is applied. If the dependent variable is binary, then a Sigmoid function or 
a Theshold function is applied. The output from the neuron is then multipled with the weight going from the neuron
to the neuron in output layer or other forward layers and simmilar calculations happen in the next neuron.
