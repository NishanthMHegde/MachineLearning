Cost Function: The cost function is used to keep track of the error rate of our Neural Network. 

Steps:

1. Select the first observation or row of our data. Input the observation with each column/feature 
being fed to one seperate input node in input layer.
2. Feed forward the input along with its product with the weight from each of the input neuron
to the neuron in the hidden layer.
3. Apply an Activation function at the hidden layer neurons and feed forward the result with their
products of the weights to the output layer neuron. 
3. Calculate the Predicted value Yi or ( pronounces as Y hat). 
4. Let Yi be the predicted value and Y be the actual value for the observation.
5. Calculate the cost function by using the formula C = 1/2 * (Yi - Y)^2. 
6. Repeat the steps 1 to 5 and store the value of each record. 
7. Find the sum of cost functions of all the rows or observations in the data. We find sigma(C).
8. Minimize the cost function value by adjusting the weights at each neuron. For this use
GRADIENT DESCENT.
